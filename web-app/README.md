<h1 align="center">Welcome to LETSCSS(*) üëã</h1>

> A very simple and basic starter boilerplate template based on Lit-Element + Typescript + SASS + Constructible Stylesheet + Storybook and *with no bundler involved (thanks to Snowpack 2)*

> _(*) LETSCSS stands for Lit-Element-Typescript-Sass-Constructed-Stylesheet-Storybook_

## Install

```sh
npm run init
```

## Usage

```sh
snowpack dev

# if you decide to showcase your webcomponent into storybook, then run this as well
# (note that storybook will be proxified behind snowpack dev server on http://localhost:8080/storybook/) :
cd storybook && npm run storybook
```

It provides out of the box :
- TS Compiler watch
- SASS Compiler watch
- Sourcemaps
- Files served on an HTTP Server
- Global CSS rules being applicable to every Web Components thanks to `Constructible StyleSheets`
- Storybook for your components' stories
- No build tool complexity involved : everything is in the `package.json`'s `script` section

## Compat

As date of this writing, it works with most ever green browsers :  
‚úÖ Chrome (79.0.3945.88)  
‚úÖ Firefox (72.0.1)  
‚úÖ Safari (12.1.1)  
‚úÖ Microsoft EDGE (79.0.309.58)  
‚ùå Microsoft Internet Explorer  
‚ùå Microsoft EDGE versions not based on chrome builds, or based on old Chrome version  

## Behind the scenes

[`@pika/snowpack`](https://github.com/pikapkg/snowpack) (_previously named `@pika/dev`_) to convert every compilation dependencies
(located in `package.json`'s `dependencies` section) to web bundles copied once for all (at `npm install` time) in `web_components/` folder)

**SASS** compilation is splitted in 2 :
- Applicative SASS compilation
- Vendors SASS compilation (example illustrated with the `foundation` CSS lib, but you can use whatever lib you want here).   
  _Because we don't want to spend all our CPU time for third party vendors SASS dependencies that never change over time._


**Storybook** relies on [`storybook-prebuilt`](https://github.com/open-wc/storybook-prebuilt/) (pulled from 
[openwc's demoing storybook package](https://github.com/open-wc/open-wc/tree/master/packages/demoing-storybook)) in 
order to avoid any build took like babel/webpack.  
The important thing you need to understand about this is :
- To make it work properly, you will have to run `npm run storybook:build` in order to generate the storybook prebuilt version
- If you change anything on your storybook config (updating `.storybook/*` files like adding an addon), then execute this command
  again in order to update your prebuilt storybook assets
- Once you have your `storybook-prebuilt` assets generated, then you can start storybook by running `npm run storybook` and
  storybook will be served on http://localhost:8001/
